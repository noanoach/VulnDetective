--- Vulnerability Analysis ---

line 1: strcpy does not check the size of the input. It can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.
line 4: The code uses gets(), which is a vulnerable function because it doesn't perform any input validation.  It's susceptible to buffer overflows if the user enters more data than the allocated buffer can hold.
line 8: The code uses puts(), which doesn't check the size of the output. It might lead to a buffer overflow if the output exceeds the allocated buffer.
line 12: The code uses malloc, which is vulnerable to memory corruption if the user provides a null pointer or a large value.
line 16: The code uses frees, which is vulnerable to a memory leak if the allocated memory is not freed.
line 19: The code uses sprintf, which doesn't perform any input validation. It can lead to a format string vulnerability if the input is not sanitized correctly.
line 22: The code uses the `printf` function, which doesn't validate input.  It could be vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities.
line 25: The `sprintf` function doesn't perform input validation.
Line 51: Input validation failure. The code doesn't validate the input to ensure it doesn't exceed the allocated buffer size.
Line 52: Buffer overflow potential. The `strcpy` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than 8 bytes.
Line 53: Format string vulnerability. The `unsafeFunctionY` function uses `strcpy` with a format string, making it vulnerable to format string exploits.
Line 54: Input handling vulnerability. The `unsafeInput` function doesn't properly sanitize the input, potentially allowing for injection attacks.
Line 55: Integer overflow potential. The `strcpy` function can lead to integer overflow if the input string is longer than 8 bytes.
Line 56: Hardcoded secret. The code reveals the secret input through `hardcodedSecret()`.
Line 57: Potential format string vulnerability.  The `unsafeFunctionY` uses a format string, exposing potential vulnerabilities.
Line 58: Potential buffer overflow.  The `strcpy` call is prone to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the allocated buffer.
Line 59: Input validation failure. The `safeFunctionX` lacks input validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Line 60: Buffer overflow. The `strcpy` call is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
Line 61: Input validation failure. The `safeFunctionX` lacks input validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Line 62: Format string vulnerability. The `unsafeFunctionY` uses a format string, making it vulnerable to format string exploits.
Line 63: Input Handling Vulnerability. The code uses input without validation.
Line 64: Potential integer overflow.  The `strcpy` call could result in integer overflow if the input is large.
Line 65: Hardcoded secret. The secret input is visible through the `hardcodedSecret()` function.
Line 66: Potential format string vulnerability. The `unsafeFunctionY` utilizes a format string, potentially causing vulnerabilities.
Line 67: Potential buffer overflow. The `strcpy` call is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
Line 68: Input Validation Failure. The `safeFunctionX` lacks input validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Line 69: Integer Overflow. The `strcpy` call can lead to integer overflow.
Line 70: Potential format string vulnerability. The `unsafeFunctionY` utilizes a format string, potentially causing vulnerabilities.
Line 71: Input Validation Failure. The `safeFunctionX` lacks input validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Line 72: Potential buffer overflow. The `strcpy` call is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
Line 73: Input Handling Vulnerability. The code uses input without validation.
Line 74: Potential integer overflow. The `strcpy` call could result in integer overflow if the input is large.
Line 75: Hardcoded secret. The secret input is visible through the `hardcodedSecret()` function.
Line 76: Potential format string vulnerability. The `unsafeFunctionY` uses a format string, potentially causing vulnerabilities.
Line 77: Input Validation Failure. The `safeFunctionX` lacks input validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Line 78: Potential buffer overflow. The `strcpy` call is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
Line 79: Input Handling Vulnerability. The code uses input without validation.
Line 80: Potential integer overflow. The `strcpy` call could result in integer overflow if the input is large.
